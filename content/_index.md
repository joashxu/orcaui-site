OrcaUI is a customizable UI component Library for Django Projects. It is built on top of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com), [Django Slippers](https://github.com/mixxorz/slippers) and [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/).
It provides developers with a collection of reusable UI components that are easy to integrate and extend for modern web applications.
Simply copy and paste the components you need into your Django project, enable it in your `components.yaml` file and you are done.
You can customize them to fit your requirements.

## Building Blocks

- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. 
- **DaisyUI**: Prebuilt components based on TailwindCSS for quick and accessible design. 
- **Django Slippers**: A templating system that integrates seamlessly with Django, providing reusable UI components. 
- **Alpine.js**: A minimal, declarative JavaScript framework that provides interaction without the complexity of larger frameworks.
